##R function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computation

##makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to

## 1.set the value of the matrix
## 2.get the value of the matrix
## 3.set the value of the solve
## 4.get the value of the solve

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}

## The following function calculates the solve of the special "matrix" created with the above function. However, it first checks
## to see if the solve has already been calculated. If so, it gets the solve from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the solve of the matrix and sets the value of the solve in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  s <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  s
}
